# FLAMES Matchmaking and Zodiac Form

This form takes two people's names and birthdates as input. It will output the matchmaking results of the two people based on a defined algorithm and the zodiac of each person based on their birthdate.

For the matchmaking computation, count the number of similar letters between the two names. Add the total count then get the remainder when divided by 6. The resulting number corresponds with a letter in FLAMES (F=1, L=2, A=3, M=4, E=5, S=0).

Note: F – Friends, L – Lovers, A – Anger, M – Married, E – Engaged, S – Soulmates
